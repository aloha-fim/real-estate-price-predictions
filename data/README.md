# Home Value Predictions in Greater Boston Area

A home is often the largest and most expensive purchase a person makes in his or her lifetime. Ensuring homeowners have a trusted way to monitor this asset is incredibly important. While many individual homebuyers are less sensitive to price forecasts, small errors in price prediction can have systemic negative effects in the economy as a whole. Accurate prediction makes it easier to understand which features would influence the final property price. 

## Problem statement

Real estate prices are very much dependent on factors that are not easy to control. Analyzing broader market conditions and specific property determinants in order to establish how property values may change over the course of time are utterly important. Massive data can be obtained about the current market situation, which demands using powerful machine learning algorithms in order to predict with high precision and in a reasonable time frame. 

### Goal

Build a home valuation algorithm from the ground up, using both, internal and external data sources. Compare final predictions against other popular algorithms estimated values.
