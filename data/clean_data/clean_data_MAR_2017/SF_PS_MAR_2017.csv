The contemporary farmhouse design invites you in with a highly desirable open concept living space, yet maintains practicality with a first floor den that is intentionally positioned away from the activity, allowing for a home office, private space, or guest room. The kitchen faces the east, taking advantage of morning light, while the living room soaks up the afternoon sun. On the second floor - a master bedroom with a tiled en suite bath and walk in closet, three additional bedrooms, convenient 2nd floor laundry and a large hallway linen closet. You will appreciate the efficient gas heat, central air, tiled baths, and hardwood floors throughout. This home is built to modern energy standards, with net zero ready construction.
